# Terraform Bootstrap for Remote Backend (S3)

## Overview

This repository contains the **bootstrap configuration** required to set up a remote backend for Terraform using AWS S3. It provisions an S3 bucket with versioning enabled to securely store and manage Terraform state files.

Using a dedicated bootstrap step ensures that the infrastructure backend is properly initialized before deploying the main infrastructure. This separation follows best practices in infrastructure as code by isolating critical state management from the rest of the provisioning workflow.

## What This Project Does

- Creates an S3 bucket to hold Terraform remote state
- Enables versioning on the bucket to keep historical changes to the state file
- Tags the bucket for easy identification and management


For this project we are working on provisioning infrastuctures for Java and python app. I use gitworkflow automation to provisiong Ec2 severs for the java app and python app. both applications will be running on different server. in the .github/work flow, i have the ci pipeline. GitHub Actions looks specifically into this directory (.github/workflow) to find the yml file and run your automation pipelines. my bootstrap foler contains Separate Initialization from my Main Infrastructure.it consist of hhe S3 bucket for Terraform state is foundational— which we need before before we can run other Terraform scripts that depend on remote state.  In my infra folder, i have the terraform files main.tf, variable.tf and variable.tfvars, which defines the actual infrastructure resources and configurations using Terraform.
